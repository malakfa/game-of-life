# game-of-life
The Game of Life is a simulation game developed by mathematician John Conway as an exploratory model The life cycle of the living organism.

Played on a huge matrix whose members are sites
Possible life (existence): each site can have one of the following two situations:
A. "There is a life" - a full life site - will be marked as a full square
B. "There is no life" - an empty life site - we will mark it as an empty square


#These rules, which compare the behaviour of the automaton to real life, can be condensed into the following:

1)Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
2)Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
3)All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

The program will generate a matrix with random values that represent the initial life states. Every time the button is pressed, the program will calculate the life states of the next generation and update the display accordingly.
